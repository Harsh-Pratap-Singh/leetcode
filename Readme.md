### 1st Problem
**Difficulty: Easy**
This problem bears a resemblance to the merge step in the merge-sort algorithm. It is relatively straightforward, with:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n + m)

### 2nd Problem
**Difficulty: Easy**
This problem involves checking whether consecutive numbers in a list are identical and excluding duplicates. The solution entails:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### 3rd Problem
**Difficulty: Easy (Moderate)**
This problem revolves around finding the index of a substring within a larger string. It is slightly more challenging but still falls within the easy category:

I did pseudocode with python 
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### 4th Problem
**Difficulty: Easy**
This problem addresses the task of finding the insertion point of a target element in a sorted array while adhering to the following constraints:

Since O(logn) was given in the problem ,my first approach was to do binary search :

- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### 5th Problem
**Difficulty: Easy**
This problem is easy to solve if you thing form backword of the array not from forward because i first approach it with the forward approach i can not pass the one test case :

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
