### 1st Problem
**Difficulty: Easy**
This problem bears a resemblance to the merge step in the merge-sort algorithm. It is relatively straightforward, with:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n + m)

### 2nd Problem
**Difficulty: Easy**
This problem involves checking whether consecutive numbers in a list are identical and excluding duplicates. The solution entails:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### 3rd Problem
**Difficulty: Easy (Moderate)**
This problem revolves around finding the index of a substring within a larger string. It is slightly more challenging but still falls within the easy category:

I did pseudocode with python 
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### 4th Problem
**Difficulty: Easy**
This problem addresses the task of finding the insertion point of a target element in a sorted array while adhering to the following constraints:

Since O(logn) was given in the problem ,my first approach was to do binary search :

- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### 5th Problem
**Difficulty: Easy**
This problem is easy to solve if you thing form backword of the array not from forward because i first approach it with the forward approach i can not pass the one test case :

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### 6th Problem
**Difficulty: Easy**
My first approach was to add all the numbers and then divide the sum by 2. If the remainder was not 0, I considered that as the answer.If 0 then using while loop . However, this method only satisfied 6 out of 61 test cases (excluding negative numbers).

After reviewing discussions, I decided to explore a different approach using XOR.

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

### 7th Problem
**Difficulty: Medium**
Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array.

The task is to find the first and last positions of an element in a sorted array with a desired time complexity of O(logn). I recognized that binary search would be a suitable approach, and then I employed two distinct loops to find the first and last positions.

- Time Complexity: O(logn)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
